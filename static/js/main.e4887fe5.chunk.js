Either your limit is so far beyond what we can achieve with this level of technology or something is wrong with the brain scanner.

That\u2019s one of the biggest advantages of being able to accelerate time. We don\u2019t need someone who is the absolute best in any field because we have the time to train them.

He didn\u2019t mind how long the projects took because they were truly advancing science and the human race. Most importantly, it seemed like failure was an option as long as something was learned along the way. After all, most of what the company did was research until they came up with something truly incredible like True VR."}),Object(C.jsx)(ne,{children:"\u201cAlright, well that\u2019s really all I had for you today,\u201d Jerry said as he got up from his chair. \u201cGo relax in the lounge, have some dinner, rearrange your office, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something to do before you get some sleep.\u201d"}),Object(C.jsx)(ne,{children:"Adam stood up, shook Jerry\u2019s hand, and headed for the door."}),Object(C.jsx)(ne,{children:"\u201cI\u2019ll schedule another meeting for us in a few days, just to check in again and make sure things are still going smoothly,\u201d Jerry mentioned as he opened the door."}),Object(C.jsx)(ne,{children:"\u201cSounds good sir,\u201d Adam said as he left the room. \u201cSee you then.\u201d"}),Object(C.jsx)(ne,{children:"Adam thought about redecorating again when he got back to his office after being so impressed by what Jerry had done with his.
