          James leaned back against an old, yet sturdy wooden fence. The
          previous night’s weather had draped a thin layer of snow across it,
          and much more of the white powder covered the trail in front of him.
          It was three inches at best since it wasn’t quite high enough to get
          inside his shoes.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          In front of him, a little cream-colored Pomsky named Sparky ran
          circles in the fresh snow. It amazed James how much energy the tiny
          dog had after the couple miles he and his other companion, Ellie, had
          already hiked. Back at the parking lot, he’d thought that if he and
          Ellie were on the trails for more than an hour, Sparky would need to
          be kept inside one of their jackets to stay warm.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Taking his mind off Sparky for a moment, he turned to his left to see
          that Ellie’s dark blue eyes were frozen in focus on her phone. James
          expected it, considering that she’d spent most of the drive to the
          park talking about the fancy new camera attachment she’d just bought a
          week ago. According to her, it was like carrying a DSLR in her pocket
          for a fraction of the cost.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Directly on the other side of the fence was a few feet of ground
          sitting underneath even more snow than the trail, but beyond that was
          a sixty foot drop off the edge of a cliff. The valley below them had a
          small pond that had long since frozen over for the winter, and it was
          surrounded by multitude of trees that filled the area and continued
          for a few miles to the north. Many of the trees held several inches of
          snow that was still accumulating from the thousands upon thousands of
          snowflakes falling from the sky. They pranced, floated, and danced as
          though they were attending an extravagant ball until they found a seat
          to wait and watch as the rest of their friends followed.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Despite the attention Ellie had been giving her phone, she apparently
          still noticed James’ gaze. “You can stop it with those big, brown
          puppy dog eyes. I’m done taking pictures.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James knelt down and pretended to scold Sparky. “You heard her, boy.
          No more puppy dog eyes.” He stood back up and slid over next to Ellie.
          “Was the camera attachment everything you told me it would be?” Right
          when he looked down at the screen of her phone, he noticed the
          slightest movement in Ellie’s finger followed by the faint sound of a
          click.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “I think that selfie might be the best picture of the entire hike.”
          She smirked at James, then pocketed her phone.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James threw his hands in the air and started walking down the trail
          with Sparky. “Fine, I’ll just look through the pictures at brunch.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie quickly caught up and lightly ran into James’ shoulder. “I’ll
          make another slice of French toast to make up for it. Some extra
          blueberries too!”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James looked down to see her puffing her lip up and pouting. “Any
          extra slice you make is going to go straight into your sister’s
          stomach. You know she’s going to be hungry after track practice is
          over, so unless you have a whole loaf of bread to dedicate to this
          meal, there’s no way you have enough food to feed everyone.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie took a quarter turn towards James, stopped pouting, and put her
          hand on her hips. “Lucky for you, I got a special loaf just for the
          occasion.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “You mean you got the Stephanie loaf, because she’s going to devour
          everything!”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          There were a few seconds of silence followed by loud laughter from
          both of them. Sparky joined in with a few yips of his own.{' '}
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          In the midst of their laughing fit, James had found it necessary to
          lean against the wooden fence yet again so he didn’t fall to the
          ground. After regaining composure, he noticed some animal tracks on
          the other side. They looked like dog prints, or at least a related
          animal, except that they were all the same size. With all the time
          he’d spent holding Sparky’s leash on the hike, he recognized that
          front and back paws made different size prints.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Hey, come take a look at this.” James motioned Ellie over to the
          fence and pointed out the odd tracks in the snow. “Have you ever seen
          something like this before?”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie coughed a few times as she forced herself to stop laughing and
          walked over to the fence. “They just look like animal prints to me.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Yeah, but they’re all the same size. Sparky’s front and back paws
          leave different size prints, and I’m sure any other animal, like a
          rabbit, a squirrel, or a wolf, all do the same thing.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Are you…” Elie stifled a laugh. “Are you trying to tell me that
          there’s an animal that lives only in this park and always walks on its
          hind legs?”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Maybe whatever it is broke both its front legs and it had to learn to
          do it to survive?” James suggested. “I kind of want to go find it.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Right before the last spot you were talking about how hungry you
          were. I seem to remember you complaining about how early it was and
          that you hadn’t eaten anything yet today.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “I can wait a few more minutes to check this out.” James tilted his
          head up to follow where the tracks went. “It looks like they go around
          the edge of the cliff to the mouth of the valley. Even if we don’t
          find whatever made the tracks, I bet you can at least get some good
          camera shots out there.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie looked up and pointed to the sky. “Because the camera can see so
          far with even more snow falling.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James hadn’t noticed, but realized she was right that it had started
          snowing a little bit harder since the moved on from the last spot. He
          tried to quickly come up with another excuse for her to go, only to
          realize that it would require one thing that he disliked more than any
          other. “Fine, I’ll take a real selfie with you if you come along.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          With the mere mention of the word, selfie, Ellie almost instantly
          covered the short distance between them. She turned James around so
          she could him in the eye. “Really?”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “<i>After</i> we get back to the car.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Immediately, a huge smile grew on Ellie’s face, filled with teeth
          shinier than the snow around them. She then placed her gloved hands on
          the top rail of the fence and vaulted herself over. “I hope for your
          sake that the view is as awesome as you think it’s going to be.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James sighed, knowing there was likely no way she would forget the
          deal he’d just made. He reached down, picked up Sparky, and carefully
          climbed over the fence. Ellie led the way as they followed the tracks
          through the snow. Being off the maintained trail, they had to deal
          with some overgrown and unkempt bushes along with low hanging tree
          branches, not all of which James saw before getting a mouthful of
          snow. Once through there, they came to a stop underneath a large maple
          tree standing around eight feet from the edge of the cliff. Sparky,
          having spent the entirety of their brief trip squirming and yipping to
          be freed, finally got his wish to be back on the ground to continue
          his fluffy white adventures.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie looked out over the edge, surveying their new vantage point
          while fumbling to get her phone back out of her pocket. “This is…
          absolutely amazing. Just look at how the cliffs forming the edge of
          the valley start right here. It looks like a giant cupped its hands
          around everything down there, and that pond is just like trying to
          scoop water with your hand only for it to slowly trickle out the
          bottom. It’s so beautiful here!”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “And <i>you</i> didn’t even want to explore over here.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie shot a death glare at James before turning back towards the
          cliff to start taking pictures. She brushed some snow away where she
          was standing, then knelt down to get a more stable shot. James watched
          her work her magic with the camera for the first photo until his
          attention was redirected to Sparky tugging on his leash.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James watched Sparky continue to enamor himself with the snow. Out
          here away from the trail, Sparky was no longer limited to the little
          bit of snow from overnight that was continuing to fall. Now he had all
          the powder that had built up over the week, allowing him to jump in
          and out of the snow like a little groundhog. He never once had to pull
          Sparky back from the edge of the cliff, likely because the snow wasn’t
          quite as deep there and wouldn’t have been nearly as much fun.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Seeing that Sparky was entertained for the moment, James began looking
          for the tracks they’d followed to find this spot. He assumed that with
          Ellie leading that she had followed them, but they were no where to be
          found. Their own footprints destroyed any chance of going back and
          restarting the search. James sighed, knowing that they may never get
          to see the one-of-a-kind creature walking on its hind legs.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Suddenly, Sparky stopped prancing around and started sniffing
          something near the base of the maple tree. At first glance, it looked
          like a large pile of snow had fallen out of the tree. A little tug on
          the leash didn’t deter Sparky’s investigation, so James walked over to
          figure out what was going on.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James squatted down next to where Sparky was burying his nose in the
          snow. “I hope you didn’t find a dead animal. You know you’ll get sick,
          right?”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          When he moved his hands to pick Sparky up, he felt his glove graze
          against something hard, much harder and heavier than he expected a
          dead animal would feel even it had been frozen underneath the snow.
          James began brushing away the snow to find a large, leather-bound
          book. The white cover and silver writing across the front made it
          blend in so well with the snow that if Sparky hadn’t found it, the
          book may never have been found. He picked it up, shook the rest of the
          snow off, and took his gloves off to begin examining it.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          The silver writing across the front was entirely made up of symbols
          that he’d never seen before and made absolutely no sense. He began
          flipping through pages of the book to see if there was something he
          could understand. To his dismay, even though there were pictures every
          few pages, there wasn’t a single thing he could comprehend in the
          entire book.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “What are you and Sparky looking at?” James looked up to see Ellie in
          the midst of a 360-degree panoramic shot.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Sparky found a book hiding underneath the snow. There’s some
          pictures, but I can’t read any of it.” James stood up and held the
          book open for her to see.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie put her phone away and walked over to James to get a closer look
          at the book. “I wonder who left it here?”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Who knows? There’s no way anyone without a dog like Sparky would ever
          find it in this weather. By the time they did, it’d probably be
          ruined.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “That’s weird.” Ellie took one of her gloves off and moved her hand to
          feel one of the pages. “It doesn’t even look like the pages are wet
          from the snow.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          The moment that James and Ellie were both touching the book, they were
          given a light electric shock. Ellie immediately pulled her hand away
          while James bobbled the book a few times before regaining control.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James looked at Ellie and almost immediately burst out laughing. “Your
          hair… Your hair is standing on end like you spent the last five
          minutes rubbing it with a balloon.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie reached her hands up to where her hair normally laid only to
          find frizzy red strands pointed out in all directions except what was
          pressed underneath her headband. She scrunched her eyebrows and
          retorted, “The only reason your stupid hair isn’t doing it is because
          you wore a hat!”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James couldn’t stop laughing, and Sparky joined the raucous with his
          yipping. The laughter stopped after he got pelted in the face with a
          snowball. Ellie then pulled the leash out of his hand and began
          walking back towards the trail. James picked the book up and quickly
          followed.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” James said as he walked behind Ellie. “Now, I
          think I have an idea that might make you feel better.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “It had better be a good one, because there’s no way I’m taking a
          selfie with you if my hair is still like this when we get back to the
          car.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Who do we both know that’s a little annoying and could use a good
          practical joke?” James lightly elbowed Ellie a few times. “You know
          exactly who I’m thinking of, right?”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Are you suggesting we shock my sister?” Ellie lightly chuckled.
          “She’ll jump through the ceiling if we do that!”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “That’s why we <i>have</i> to do it! If it works as well as we think
          it will on her, I’ll have to do it to my brother, Alex, too!”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Just before they got back to the fence, Ellie stopped and stared at an
          oak tree next to their path. “Do you remember seeing this carved on
          the tree earlier?” She pointed at a symbol on the tree at about eye
          level. “It looks like one of those weird tribal symbols people get as
          tattoos.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James took a closer look at the symbol. “I don’t remember seeing it. I
          think it looks like something from the book we just found. Maybe the
          people who lost the book carved it?”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie took a photo of the symbol when James’ stomach made an audibly
          loud grumble. “Is it time to go eat brunch yet?”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Says the guy who said we just <i>had</i> to go exploring over there.”
          She hopped over the fence started running down the trail with Sparky
          in tow. “Last one back to the car has to do the dishes!”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James yelled back, “That’s not fair of you taking advantage of my
          freshman fifteen!”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          &nbsp;
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ten minutes later, James caught up with Ellie back at the parking lot.
          She’d already started the car and put Sparky in the back seat. She was
          leaning against the trunk of the little sedan with crossed arms and a
          smug look on your face. “I thought you were hungry.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James hunched over to catch his breath. “Just because I’m tall doesn’t
          mean I’m fast.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “Maybe I’ll give you a head start next time. Now let’s go. If we don’t
          get out of here soon, we’re going to find an angry Stephanie at home
          waiting to devour us!”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “I thought you wanted selfie, or are you miraculously letting me go
          this time?” James realized the stupidity of his statement as soon as
          it came out of his mouth.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          “You think I’m going to take a selfie with my hair like this?” She
          pointed at her hair that was still standing on end, although it had
          settled a bit and looked a little windblown from running. “I guess it
          doesn’t make a difference anyway. It’s not like you’ve taken a good
          picture with me since we were in middle school.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James stood up and leaned against the car next to Ellie. She leaned
          into his side and snapped several shots.
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie sighed. “Stupid book ruining my chance for the perfect post-hike
          selfie. I may never have a chance again.”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          James looked down at Ellie’s hands doing things with her phone when he
          realized that she only had one glove on. “What happened to your other
          glove?”
        </Text>
        <Text textAlign="left" paddingBottom="1em">
          Ellie paused what she was doing, then contorted her face in all sorts
          of ways while she thought. “I took one off when you showed me the
