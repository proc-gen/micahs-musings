          Ever since I was very young, I've loved reading books. My mother
          volunteered at the library for many years, and I came along with her
          all the time. Sometimes there was a story hour where I would listen to
          her or one of the other librarians read 1-2 childrens books. While I
          admit, I usually had a horrible time sitting still for these sessions,
          I loved getting caught up in the stories and visualizing what was
          going on in my imagination.

          As I grew a little older, story hours turned into me spending hours
          reading books on my own. I sank a lot of time into series like
          Animorphs, The Boxcar Children, The Magic Tree House Series, and all
          things Wizard of Oz to name a few. Then in third grade I found Harry
          Potter, which coincidentally only had the first three books out. In
          preparation for the fourth, I read each of the first three at least
          five times in the month before the release, and was likely all I read
          at that point in time.

          When I made it to high school and college, much less time was spent on
          reading because of sports and other interests taking priority, but I
          still made room for good books I came across like Fight Club, Running
          with the Buffalos, Once a Runner, and the Circle trilogy (now
          quadrilogy) by Ted Dekker. In my adult life I've discovered series
          like Sword Art Online, Ender's Game as well as Ender's Shadow, Maze
          Runner, and Mortality Doctrine.

          I know that this is supposed to be the overview for writing, not
          reading, so I'll try to get there soon. It's all about the journey,
          right?

          Remember how I said that I loved getting caught up in stories and
          visualizing what was going on? That never stopped. If I had a quarter
          for every time I found my eyes glossing over words on the page because
          something on the previous page made my mind wander, I'd never have to
          work again. Sometimes it was thinking about if I was in the main
          character's shoes, sometimes it was thinking about if I was with the
          main characters, but most of the time it was imagining the world and
          everything in it. After so much time reading and imagining these
          things, I finally got the idea that I wanted to write a story myself.

          My first foray into writing was a short story I wrote in sixth grade
          about the Neon Man from Neptune. I think at this point the only reason
          I still remember writing it is because I didn't want to tell my
          parents I forgot to type up the final copy, so I spent an hour or so
          after my bedtime writing the final copy in pen on loose leaf paper
          because it was still an acceptable way to turn it in. I'm also fairly
          certain I used the same premise for a short story assignment a year or
          two later in an effort to make the story better. Neither one was
          amazing, and the problems likely stemmed from me trying to do too much
          in a small space.

          Sometime in the months after my mother passed away, I decided I wanted
          to write a novel. The two attempts from that time were essentially
          stories where I was the main character and I was being transported to
          some fantastical land that made me forget about all my problems. One
          was a fun, but short lived attempt, while the other made it through a
          change from first to third person and eventually one finished draft of
          about 75k words my junior year of college. I've tried several times to
          rewrite the story only to get writer's block after 20-30 pages.
          Someday I'll hopefully be able to go back and give that story justice.

          At the present, I have one story I'm actively working on called "When
          Worlds Collide" (a working title) that's an urban fantasy as well as
          one currently on the shelf called "The Dangers of Teleporting" (also a
          working title) that's science fiction.
