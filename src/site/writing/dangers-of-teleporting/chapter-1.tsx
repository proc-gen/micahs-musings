            Adam tightened his navy-blue tie as he hurried along the sidewalk.
            He stared up at the tall, ivory building before walking in through
            the revolving door. It was his first day at Omni Artisan Systems and
            the last thing he wanted to do was be late to meet his boss.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Omni Artisan Systems, OAS for short, was an up and coming technology
            company that had just announced that they were a few months away
            from releasing the True VR headset, a device that could send data
            directly to and from the human brain. The medical community was in
            an uproar. The possibility of creating a virtual environment for
            terminally ill patients to enjoy themselves was the most popular
            idea so far. Another idea was to send signals to a comatose
            patient’s mind to wake them up and bring them back to the real
            world. The most ambitious idea to date was try and rewrite portions
            of our subconscious brain processes to eliminate diseases
            altogether. It was this kind of innovation to help people that had
            drawn Adam to want to work for OAS.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam’s last job was designing and optimizing systems for factory
            line processes. Somebody would analyze a system to determine if any
            bottlenecks existed. Adam was given the resulting information and he
            would design a new machine that would reduce the bottleneck or
            eliminate it entirely. It was partially fulfilling because it was
            fun for Adam to solve a challenge, but not completely because he
            knew that it only meant that someone could manufacture their product
            ten times faster than before.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Hello,” Adam gasped as he reached the front desk of OAS. “My name
            is Adam Cloud and this is my first day here at OAS.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Oh, hello dear,” the receptionist replied. “Jerry told me to be
            expecting you this morning. Let me ping him so he can come down here
            to meet you. You can sit in wait in one of the chairs over there. It
            should only be a few minutes.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Thank you,” Adam replied as he turned and headed to take a seat.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam couldn’t quite figure out why he was so nervous. He couldn’t
            remember being like this when he started his last job, or even his
            first real job out of college. He knew that he should be more
            confidant with his level of experience, but he was still in
            disbelief that he had gotten the job.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            When Adam was still in the interview process, he knew that the bulk
            of work he had completed for his last job wasn’t going to cut it.
            Optimizing systems, no matter how good he was at it, had nothing to
            do with designing new systems from scratch. Luckily one of the more
            recent systems he had worked on was for a product that OAS had
            already released. The device in question was used to read brainwaves
            and output what the subject was thinking to a computer screen. The
            microprocessors used in the device had an extremely low yield when
            the product was released, but after three weeks of working on it
            Adam was able to get the yields to over 50% per batch which was far
            better than the 5-7% they had originally seen.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Good to see you again, Adam,” Jerry said as he thrust out his hand
            for a handshake.{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “It’s good to see you too, sir,” Adam stammered as he shook Jerry’s
            hand.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Please, call me Jerry,” his boss said as they started walking. “Now
            I’m sure you were prepared for today to be mostly boring stuff like
            learning rules and filling out paperwork. With us releasing the True
            VR headset so soon we’ve already started using it in house. Now what
            would’ve taken you an entire day can be done in less than an hour
            because of how fast your brain is able to process the data.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “An hour?” Adam asked as they walked through a set of double doors.
            “That’s insane!”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “It still takes time for the printer to keep up so we have physical
            copies of everything, but it has definitely helped with productivity
            around here. We’re working on transitioning how we collaborate and
            design our projects to use the system. You’re able to get so much
            done in so little time in the VR environment and you feel like you
            just took a nap when you wake up.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Aren’t you worried that other companies will start doing the same
            thing after it’s released?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Of course, we expect that to happen. Part of finishing the True VR
            solution is making our internal software usable by everyone. Sell
            the software and then make them pay fees to get updates and
            technical support. It’s the same way with any other large-scale
            product in the software industry.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Jerry and Adam walked through another set of double doors before
            heading up an elevator to the third floor. The entire building had
            been plain so far. Grey linoleum floors and off-white walls lit up
            with the standard fluorescent lighting. The same plain decor awaited
            them once they arrived on the third floor. A few doors later and
            they walked into a room filled with cubicles that each had a person
            wearing a True VR headset. All except for one.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Hi Carol,” Jerry said. “This is Adam’s first day so we need to get
            him setup in the system.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Sure thing, Jerry,” Carol responded with a fake smile. “He’s only
            what, the fourth new employee we’ve had this week?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Don’t worry, I think we have a couple more. Well, I’ll leave him in
            your hands then.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Why did it have to be my week on newbie duty to have all the new
            hires start showing up,” Carol muttered as Jerry left the room.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Hi, I’m Adam” he stuttered as he stuck out his hand.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Yeah. I heard,” Carol said as she got up from her desk completely
            ignoring Adam’s gesture. She walked over to an empty cube and turned
            the computer on. “Ok, so when the computer is done booting up you’ll
            just log on as the guest user. There’s only one program that runs
            under that user, so it’ll start by prompting you to put on the
            headset and then it’ll take you through getting everything setup.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>“Th… Thanks”</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Carol wasn’t even three steps away from the cube when the logon
            screen popped up. Adam followed her instructions and in moments he
            had the True VR headset on and he was starting his first full-dive
            experience.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam’s body immediately felt weightless as his brain was flooded
            with information. It was far more information than he’d ever had to
            process at once. Everything around him was out of focus while his
            mind was catching up. Various numbers, letters, and colors flurried
            around him while he was right there in the middle of it. Slowly the
            storm of unintelligible nonsense began rearranging itself into
            cohesive matter.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam watched as his body formed itself. Almost as if it were cell by
            cell his body pieced itself together starting with his head and
            working its way down to his fingers and toes. He bent his elbow to
            take a closer look at his hand and found that he could see just as
            much detail as he could in the real world. It was all the same right
            down to his fingerprints.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The first object to fully form itself was a chair. It was no
            ordinary work chair. It was an expensive looking leather executive
            chair. The kind of chair they usually only have in the big meeting
            rooms for when visitors came to the office. When Adam sat down he
            could feel the cushioning flatten beneath him just as he expected.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Next was a desk. A glass tabletop framed with aluminum. It had an
            underside drawer that was filled with basic office supplies.
            Pencils, pens, scissors, sticky notes, and anything else he might
            need soon.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Finally, the rest of the room formed around him. The wall behind him
            was a window that had a perfect view of Yosemite’s Half Dome. Adam
            forced himself to get out of the chair and walked up to get a closer
            look. Knocking on the glass gave the *ping* noise that he expected.
            He was still skeptical until he saw some birds flying off in the
            distance. The other walls were a light faded green with some canvas
            paintings of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado Rockies. A solid
            maple door stood in the center of the wall across from the window to
            complete the earthy nature of the room.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Just as Adam was sitting down again he noticed a laptop appear on
            the desk along with some text hovering in midair.{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Login using your first initial followed by your last name for your
            username and your first and last initial followed by your full
            numeric birth date without the slashes as your password. You’ll be
            prompted to change your password after logging in and then you’ll
            need to fill out all the documents that are currently on your
            desktop. Once those are filled out send the files to HR and wait for
            further instructions.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam stared at the text for a few moments before he followed the
            instructions. All the forms were basic information that the company
            needed in order to start the process for benefits and to setup
            automatic paychecks. Thankfully he had his checking account number
            memorized because it wasn’t exactly an option to go back to the real
            world where he had his checkbook in his leather binder.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            After sending the files to HR, Adam waited a few minutes. He didn’t
            receive an email back and the instructions were still hovering in
            midair on the other side of the desk. Not knowing what else to do,
            Adam swiped his hand through the text which caused it to fade away
            from sight.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>Moments later the door opened.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Hey, look who’s done with their paperwork already,” Jerry said as
            he walked into the room and closed the door. “How do you like your
            office?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “This is amazing!” Adam exclaimed, the first time he hadn’t felt shy
            about what he was saying that entire morning. “Everything seems so
            much more realistic than I even imagined from watching prerelease
            demos of the True VR. It’s like a completely different world.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Glad to hear that you’re liking it so far. Right now, I need to put
            you through a brain speed test and then we can go meet some of the
            other engineers you’ll be working with.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “A brain speed test? Are you sure you don’t mean an aptitude test or
            an IQ test?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Jerry produced a chair identical to the one Adam was sitting in and
            sat down on the other side of the desk. “No, I’m talking about a
            brain speed test. It’s not very technical, but it means exactly what
            it says. About how long do you think this session of VR has been
            going on for?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam scratched his chin. He knew that time moved faster in VR, but
            he didn’t know just how much faster it really was. “Around thirty
            minutes?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Not even close,” Jerry said as he pulled up a hovering console
            window. “Your session started at 9:17 based on the database record.
            Now if you look at the bottom right of the window…”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam’s jaw dropped. “There’s no way it’s only 9:23. It felt like I
            spent at least an hour going through all the paperwork for HR not to
            mention the time it took for everything in this room to load.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I promise you that it’s the real time. The environment by default
            is set to about 10 times the speed of the outside world. It’s a safe
            setting that everyone can handle and allows us to save plenty of
            real world time on work.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “If we’re already running at 10 times speed then why do we even need
            a speed test?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I only said that the environment is set to 10 times speed as a
            default. That doesn’t mean it can’t run faster. Some people just
            have different limits than others. Then there’s other cases where we
            need to interface with someone from the outside world while we’re in
            here so we slow the room down to normal speed.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>“How fast are you able to handle?”</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Jerry pulled the console window back over and started pointing and
            clicking things to start the test. Another console window popped up
            to the side of the desk with a large 15 in black print. “I can
            handle a little over 50 times normal speed. Some of your coworkers
            can hit up over 70 times.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Does something bad happen if you go over your limit?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Typically, people will start moving and talking as if they were
            drunk. What’s really happening is that the brain uses so much of its
            potential that it can’t do everything else it’s supposed to be
            doing. The more you use your brain for True VR the more everything
            else starts shutting down. We set the threshold at seventy percent
            brain activity. It’s enough that we can get substantially more than
            the 10 times speed and we still have a cushion. Right now, the
            server is monitoring your brain activity to see if you’ve hit the
            threshold. As long as your below the threshold and you aren’t
            showing any symptoms like I described it will periodically increase
            the speed till it finds your limit.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The console screen flashed and changed from 15 to 20.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “So, we’re going to just sit here and talk until I pass out?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Of course not,” Jerry said as he stood up. “If you’re going to feel
            like you’re drinking we may as well play a bar game.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Jerry started fidgeting with his console window again and moments
            later a pool table was sitting in Adam’s office.{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Are you sure that I shouldn’t be watching some sort of intro video
            or going through some training instead?” Adam asked as Jerry racked
            the pool balls. “There’s got to be something more productive than
            playing a game of pool.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I like the business focus,” Jerry said before shooting to break the
            rack. “But with as much time as we spend in the VR world we can
            afford to spend more time doing things we enjoy and less time
            actually working. Afford isn’t really the right word for that… need
            works better. You were amazed that we generally work at 10 times
            normal speed. That means if you’re logged in for an 8-hour day in
            the real world then you’ve been in here for at least 80 hours. It’s
            just not possible to work for all 80 of those hours. Even though
            your real body only sees this as 8 hours your mind sees all 80 and
            needs to be handled accordingly. You still need to sleep, interact
            with other people, enjoy yourself. In other words, you still need to
            be a human being while having your mind stuck inside a computer.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam got up from his chair and walked over to pick up the other cue
            that Jerry had left leaning against the table. “How do you manage
            your time then? You already said that you can function up to 50
            times normal speed and some other people can handle higher than
            that. If you have multiple people working on a project that don’t
            have similar maxes, then it seems like they’d have scheduling
            issues.” Adam took his shot as the console screen flashed from 20 to
            25.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “That’s a fair point and one of the biggest reasons we do this
            test.” Jerry walked around the table eyeing his next target. “Take
            for example you have two people working on a project. Person A can
            function up to 20 times and Person B can function up to 40 times.
            This leaves you with two choices. The first choice is to limit
            Person B to max out at 20 times during the course of the project.
            This fixes the scheduling conflict but Person B is only using 50% of
            their capacity. The second choice is to not limit Person B which
            causes the scheduling conflict and places an unfair burden on them
            because they have the potential to get twice as much work done.
            Neither one of those is an optimal situation.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “So, what solution did you come up with? You have to have something
            in place if you manage people who have a higher max than yourself.”
            Adam said as he watched Jerry shoot three stripes in before
            scratching.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “The solution was twofold. To mitigate the problem, you previously
            mentioned we try to match up teams that have similar maxes. This way
            we don’t lose nearly as much capacity when someone has to work with
            someone of a lower max. For situations where you need to work with
            someone that’s got a different brain speed max you’ll need to meet
            during a standard time. There are periodic points in the day where
            regardless of your max we force you to run at the standard 10 times.
            One of those times would be when we have group meetings.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam got two of the solids in during his turn but had left himself
            without a clean shot and missed to end his turn. “It seems like you
            have it all planned out. It must have taken a while to figure it out
            though.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “It took about a month of normal time to get a working system.”
            Jerry said as he sunk another stripe. “What made it easier was only
            bringing in small groups of people at a time so we could get the
            process figured out without putting the entire company into
            communication chaos.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>The console window flashed from 25 to 30.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam watched as the number of striped balls on the table dwindled
            down to one before he had another chance to catch up. “Man, you’re
            killing me this game.” He only managed to get one more solid in a
            pocket despite only having the 8 and 11 to shoot around.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Jerry calmly sank the last two balls to finish the game and leaned
            his cue against the table. “This is one of those games I like to
            play to pass the time while I’m in VR. I don’t want to go outdoors
            like a lot of people because I think it may detract from the
            experience if I go there in real life. I like shooting pool because
            it reminds me that no matter how well I plan a situation there’s
            always a chance that it still won’t go accordingly. Plus, I can play
            while having a meeting like this.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>The console flashed to 35.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Fair enough,” Adam said as he glanced over at the console. “How
            long is this going to keep going up by five?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “It’ll keep doing that until your body shows any sign that it’s
            starting to fail keeping up. Once that happens it’ll start going by
            three and finally by one. I’m going to head out now just to make
            sure I don’t get caught in here if it goes over my limit. I’ll round
            up a few of your colleagues for you to meet once the test is over.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Sounds good,” Adam said as Jerry left the room.{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            As soon as the door closed the console flashed to 45. Adam racked
            the pool balls to play a solo game to kill the time. About every
            five minutes of room time the console went up by 10. It didn’t make
            sense to Adam why it was jumping faster than when Jerry was in the
            room, but he didn’t let it bother him. When the console flashed to
            85 he was a little stunned. Jerry had said that the highest person
            he knew was in the 70 range and he passed by with the blink of an
            eye.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam stopped paying attention to the console at that point. The test
            would be over soon and he probably wouldn’t be able to work at his
            full capacity anyway if the next highest person was in the 79 range.
            As things happened to turn out, the console reached 120 when it
            started blinking between the number and the word max in big, red,
            capital letters. A few minutes later the console reset to 10 and a
            message appeared at the bottom telling him to leave his office.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            When Adam opened the door, Jerry greeted him with a pat on the back.
            “That was amazing! You just maxed out the system and judging by how
            fast it was increasing you could go faster if the system could
            handle it. Lynn here was the previous record holder at 76.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Hi, I’m Lynn,” a young lady standing to Adam’s right said as she
            raised her hand to wave.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “And this is Lee,” Jerry said as he gestured to the older man
            standing next to Lynn. “He was fairly close behind Lynn with a 72.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Good to meet you, Adam,” Lee said with a firm handshake. “With a
            brain like that you should be able to get up to speed on our project
            in no time.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Our project? So, I’ll be working with you guys?” Adam asked after
            returning his focus to Jerry.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Not right away, you still have some training to get through first,”
            Jerry said as he turned and started walking down the hallway. “But,
            I think a quick demo might keep your spirits up while you go through
            the videos.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Is it something related to the True VR?” Adam asked. “I’ve heard a
            lot about all the things they want to use it for in the medical
            field.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>Lynn and Lee both stifled laughs.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “If you had scored in the 50s or 60s then you’d be on one of those
            projects,” Jerry said while he maneuvered through menus on the door
            console. “A score like yours put you in our high-level research
            team. Your job is to work on projects that eclipse even what we’ve
            already achieved with the True VR.” Jerry opened the door as Adam
            responded. “Eclipse the True VR? The only thing that could possibly
            be better than being able to meet up instantly in a virtual world
            would be to do it in the real world.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Exactly.” Jerry gestured the other three through the door.{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The room they had just entered contained two machines that looked
            like MRI scanners. A table in between the machines had a plethora of
            items including but not limited to a potato, a rubber duck, a bottle
            of pop, and a balloon. Off to the side were two desks where Lynn and
            Lee worked when they weren’t in their own offices.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam’s jaw dropped. “I… We get to work on teleportation?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I’ll demonstrate with the rubber duck,” Lee said giving Adam a
            friendly elbow as he walked over to the table. “His name is Scotty.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee picked Scotty the rubber duck off the table and placed it on the
            bed of the left machine. After Lee pressed some buttons on the
            machine the bed started moving inside the core of the machine. Once
            the bed was fully inside a dark colored panel covered the entrance
            to the core and bright green lights began to flash from the inside.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Moments later the green lights stopped flashing on the left machine
            and the bed of the right machine began moving into the core and the
            dark colored panel closed it off. As the green lights began flashing
            in the machine on the right the bed of the left machine was on its
            way back out and Scotty was no longer on the table. In another
            minute the bed of the machine on the right was on its way out and
            Scotty was sitting there as if nothing at all had happened.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “What do you think?” Lee asked as he tossed Scotty to Adam.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam, standing there completely mesmerized by what had just happened
            failed to even realize that the rubber duck had been thrown at him
            until it hit him in the chest. He picked it up and turned it over a
            few times to inspect it before responding. “That. Was. Awesome!”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “It’s good to know you’ll enjoy working on the project,” Jerry said.
            “I know I can’t wait to see even more results from it. Now let’s get
            you back to your office so you can get through those training
            videos.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Do I have to?” Adam jokingly whined as he handed Scotty to Lynn.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Jerry opened to door back to the hallway they had come from. “Just
            remember, it may feel like a day’s worth of work in here, but in
            real world time you won’t even be close to the lunch-time break.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            They waved to Lynn and Lee as they left the room and headed back to
            Adam’s office. He hadn’t noticed before, but it already had a
            nameplate attached. Jerry showed him the link to start training on
            his laptop and created a larger second monitor before heading back
            to his own office.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “The basics of the True VR interface,” Adam mumbled to himself.
            “Finally, I’ll be able to use one of those windows that Jerry keeps
            pulling up.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “To open a console window, please move your right pointer finger in
            the shape of an infinity symbol as shown on screen,” the narrator
            said. “You will need to have a console window open to continue.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam followed the instructions and created his very own console
            window. By default, it was about the same size as his laptop screen.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “If you’d like to resize the screen, you can grab the edges and
            stretch or shrink it to the size desired,” the narrator continued.
            “Pressing the icon in the top left of your window will show a menu
            with the default programs. Select the option marked ‘Settings’.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I suppose this is where I’m thankful that my room is running at top
            speed. Even if it takes forever in here to finish it’ll only take
            about half the time or less to everyone else.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Inside the settings window please make sure that room mode is set
            to ‘Creation’. This mode allows for the creation of objects through
            using the console window interface. The other options include
            ‘Creative’ which is used for changing the laws of physics within the
            current room and ‘Realistic’ which is used for testing real life
            applications. You can also check the speed of the room in this area.
            All other options will be covered at a later point in time.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The videos continued for several hours. During this time, Adam had
            made his office three times the size it was before, added a living
            room area with a large sectional couch, a recliner that could give a
            massage, a solid oak coffee table, and a bookshelf taller than
            himself half filled with reference books and other books by his
            favorite authors. He’d also played with another feature of
            ‘Creative’ mode where he stood on the ceiling after changing the
            gravity to zero. All of it sounded like fun, but the video narration
            was doing a better job of making Adam tired.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            To his relief, he got a message from Lynn that had material to help
            bring him up to speed on the project. He pulled it open on the
            second monitor sitting on his desk and started reading through the
            material while the narrator continued to drone through the rest of
            training.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Project objective…” Adam mused to himself. “Design a device that
            can teleport organic matter from one location without physically
            moving the matter between locations. That explains why they had the
            potato sitting on the table.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam found the first document that he read to be everything the
            company was looking for from the project. There was very little
            content about how anything should work beyond not physically moving
            the matter between locations and that they wanted the location to be
            easily decided. Without too much problem solving, Adam could see
            that they wanted to be able to send the data over the wire like you
            were downloading something from the internet.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The next document he read was a project timeline. So far, they’d
            logged a little over 4000 hours on the project. Adam’s jaw dropped
            at the thought of spending that much time on the project until he
            remembered that they were working at over 70 times the speed of the
            real world. In their case, the 4000 hours translated to around 7-8
            weeks of work. Still, Adam couldn’t imagine spending that much time.
            Surely, they must have thought of bringing someone else on the
            project before they hired himself.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            As Adam took a closer look at the notes he found much of what he had
            already discovered during the earlier demonstration, but there was
            plenty of information he hadn’t yet seen. They had machines that
            could read and write data based on the matter inside them from one
            machine to another. Currently, it only worked on non-living matter
            and single-celled organisms. Multi-celled organisms usually ended up
            dying during the process.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            According to a bullet pointed list Adam found in another document,
            the current sticking point was getting a living organism to move
            over. Once they completed that task then they would move on to
            making it network capable and finally a real-life demo.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam was so enamored reading about the project he hadn’t noticed
            that the training video had ended. Lynn’s email said that he should
            go to room 691 to meet them and he hadn’t a clue on how he was
            supposed to work the door at the end of the hall.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Come on,” Adam mumbled as he started playing through the end of the
            video. “There’s got to be some sort of summary on how this all
            works. No one here could have learned it all in one go.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            In the last thirty seconds of the video he found a link to a
            reference document on a shared drive on the company network. Adam
            wished they had put that link at the beginning of the video so that
            he could have read through that instead of listening to the narrator
            drone on for hours. He opened the document, searched through the
            contents to find the section on how to choose your destination room,
            and left the office.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Think fast!” Lynn yelled as Adam entered the room.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Without a moment to process what was happening, Adam was hit in the
            face by a flying rubber duck. “What was that for?” Adam picked
            Scotty up off the floor.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “With all that extra brain speed, I thought you’d be able to catch
            it,” Lynn retorted.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Don’t think much of it,” Lee said, not bothering to move from his
            seat. “She does that every time someone opens the door. Including
            Jerry.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “My statement still stands,” Lynn said as she walked over and took
            Scotty out of Adam’s hands.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “It’s part of her way of having fun with as much time as we spend in
            here. She may have also lost the bet on how long it would be until
            you got back here.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee already had his arms up to block before Lynn threw Scotty his
            direction. “Seriously, who actually watches training videos? For a
            video that’s three hours long you know there’s going to be a summary
            at the end.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I was already halfway through the video by the time I got your
            message,” Adam said as he created a seat for himself. “I spent the
            second half reading through all the documents you sent me.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “You made it through the training video AND you read all the stuff I
            sent you?” Lynn threw her hands up as she slammed down into her
            seat. “Look out folks, we got a Brainiac on our hands.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “She may also be a little salty that you scored so much higher on
            the brain speed test,” Lee said as he turned to rejoin the
            conversation.{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Whatever,” Lynn grumbled as she started looking at something on her
            laptop.{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Now that Lynn has completely tuned us out, did you have any
            thoughts on the project so far?” Lee asked.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Umm, I guess my first question is how exactly does the scanning
            work?” Adam responded while scratching his head. “The demo made it
            seem like a giant copy machine and the documentation said that it’s
            a more advanced version of how the True VR headset scans our
            brains.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “And those are both true statements. The True VR headset focuses on
            reading and writing to our brain cells. This machine built on that
            technology in order to read everything down to a molecular level. As
            I’m sure you saw in the notes, we’re having trouble with teleporting
            living organisms. Scotty on, on the other hand, can handle it just
            fine.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “And the notes also say that they usually die in the teleportation
            process.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee got up from his chair and put the potato on the machine bed.
            “There’s a little more to it than that.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Once the teleportation was complete, Lee handed the potato to Adam
            to inspect it.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Notice how it’s not really a potato anymore,” Lee said. “Really
            it’s like someone mashed it up molecule by molecule and then somehow
            got it back to its original shape.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam held the potato and examined it. Just like Lee had said, it was
            mixed up, but only in very localized areas. He broke it in half to
            get a better look and noticed that for as mixed up as the surface
            appeared that none of the skin had made it more than just beneath
            the surface. “It only looks like the skin is barely off. It can’t be
            that far off from where it needs to be.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Ahh, but that’s how it looks to the naked eye. If you take a look
            under a microscope it would tell a much different story. The cells,
            despite having their molecular structure read by the first machine,
            just aren’t quite in the right place. A potato is fairly simple
            example where there aren’t very many cell types to worry about.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I’m guessing I don’t want to know what happens if you put a mouse
            through there,” Adam joked.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “That’s not funny,” Lynn said, still staring at her laptop screen.
            “We had a pet mouse in here till we gave a demo the first time we
            got anything to teleport reliably. Jerry got a little gung-ho about
            it and now we can’t have pets in the lab anymore.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “If we weren’t in VR it would’ve been a while to get the stench out
            of the lab too. Who knew something so small could have such a putrid
            smell,” Lee added.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Just stop talking about it,” Lynn said a little louder. “I don’t
            want to think about all the guts and hair that were all over the
            inside of the machine. UGGHH!”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “That’s just making my stomach turn,” Adam said as he put a hand on
            his belly. “The project notes said that so far you’ve tried speeding
            up the scanning process to make it work better.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “And that did help… some,” Lee’s voice drifted off. “Initially scans
            were taking around 5 seconds and now they take about half a second.
            That helped for the simple multi-celled organisms like seaweed and
            algae, but anything more complicated than that is still having
            similar issues to what you saw from the potato. Right now, we’re in
            the process of running calculations on how to decrease the scan time
            to 1/100th of a second or faster so that it’s just like taking a
            snapshot with a camera.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “For as much time as you’ve spent making the scan faster,” Adam
            thought out loud. “And don’t get me wrong, that idea makes complete
            sense to me. It sounds like what you need to happen is for time to
            freeze so that everything you scan is in the same state. The same
            thing would need to happen post process otherwise things would
            probably get jumbled up while printing the teleported object.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “You may be on to something, Adam,” Lee said with a gleam in his
            eye. “Lynn, do you remember if we ever talked about this before?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Genius boy has been here for 10 minutes and you already listen to
            him more than me,” Lynn responded. “And no, we haven’t talked about
            freezing anything before it gets teleported.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>“Well, it’s an idea.” </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee opened a console window and made a note. “It’s about the end of
            the day in here. How about we show Adam the flying room?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “You just want me to be nice,” Lynn said. “I’ll stay here and
            research the wonder boy’s idea while you two go bond. Maybe I’ll
            show up later.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Come on,” Lee pleaded. “It’s your favorite entertainment room.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam watched as they went back and forth for several minutes with
            Lee trying to convince Lynn that she should join them. No shortage
            of favors were promised, ranging from Adam making coffee from
            scratch by only using the console to create the ingredients to Lynn
            getting to be the main test runner for at least a week. The tipping
            point was when Lee said that Adam would become the chief note taker
            for the project.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “How could you promise that?” Adam whispered as they left the room
            and Lynn was just far enough ahead that she wouldn’t hear. “Making
            coffee is one thing, but do I even know enough about the project to
            be taking notes for it?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Trust me, if your notes are that bad then Lynn will take back over
            in a heartbeat,” Lee replied. “She’d be in an even worse mood if we
            didn’t convince her to join. It really is her favorite room.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “First you guys convince me to go and now you’re walking slow?” Lynn
            called back to them. “If you don’t hurry up then I’ll leave you
            behind once we get there.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Before they reached the flying room, they walked through a large,
            open common area. White tile with gold and silver specs lined the
            floor that had many sets of cafeteria style tables and chairs.
            Potted plants and trees were placed around the white marble support
            columns.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee noticed Adam looking around. “There’s lots of time that this
            place will be empty. Having different teams at different speeds
            makes it hard for everyone to have free time at the same times.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Jerry said that there were times that the system forces everyone to
            work at the standard 10x speed for meetings,” Adam said as his gaze
            shifted to the glass ceiling above them.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Running at the speed of our team those times will feel few and far
            between. Take a moment and think about it. 70x speed for 8 hours
            gives a total possible 560 hours or a little over 23 days. At that
            rate, you might have meetings once a week if you’re lucky.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I only kind of thought about the math before when I was looking
            over the project notes, but I didn’t really take into account how
            long I’d be in here for a single day before going back to the real
            world.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Don’t worry too much. We still leave in the middle of the day for
            lunch and we take weekends in here.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lynn was standing in front of the door to the flying room arms
            crossed and foot tapping. “Took you guys long enough.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I thought you were going to leave us behind,” Adam said.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lynn scrunched her eyebrows at Adam and opened the door.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “You might want to wait a little longer before poking the bear,” Lee
            whispered to Adam. “It’ll be at least a week before she starts to
            warm up to you. I’m surprised she was as well behaved as she was
            when Jerry was around.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “You know,” Lynn twisted her head back with a scowl, “I can hear
            what you’re saying.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>“And now I’m in the dog house.”</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            But Adam wasn’t paying attention to either of them at this point
            because after walking through the door he found himself standing on
            top of a tower overlooking the Grand Canyon. After taking a few
            minutes to enjoy the view, Lee pointed out the instruction panel
            that explained the basics of the flying room.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “You’re telling me there isn’t training room for this?” Adam asked,
            flabbergasted. “How am I supposed to believe this ‘Think in the
            direction you want to move’ stuff? What’s to say I won’t freefall as
            soon as I leave this platform?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lynn, who was already hovering just off the tower, grabbed Adam’s
            collar and pulled him over the edge before Lee had a chance to
            answer his question.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>“Think up!” she called after him.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee covered his face with his right hand and moved next to Lynn.
            “You didn’t need to do that.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “It’ll waste less time than giving him an explanation. And it’s not
            like it’s going to hurt if he hits the ground. It’ll give us more
            time to explore.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “More time to explore? You’ve probably covered every inch of this
            canyon by now with how much time you spend in here.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “That’s only because it’s so much fun to fly around and be free!”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Yeah,” Adam said as he rose to rejoin the group. “Feeling like
            you’re falling to your death is extremely fun.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “See?” Lynn said as she gestured towards Adam with the first smile
            she’d shown since the introductions. “I knew he’d learn fast because
            of all the brainpower that’s going unused right now.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee covered his face with his hand again. “You win, Lynn. Lead on.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lynn proceeded to use a console window to set a few waypoints that
            they would spend the next several hours investigating. They started
            out by diving down until they were just above the river’s surface
            and before gliding along low and fast enough that Adam could feel
            the mist of Lynn’s wake. His mind was still wrapping itself around
            everything else he had learned so far today and he was still amazed
            at the attention to detail he was witnessing.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Flipping over so his back was to the water, Adam watched the clouds
            for a moment. He knew that creating realistic water was one thing,
            but creating an entire sky and all the physics behind it was a whole
            other story. They’d be simulating weather itself, Adam thought. Then
            again, if they’re simulating everything to the point that they could
            realistically test their teleportation project then everything else
            is a cakewalk.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam turned himself back so he was flying with his stomach towards
            the water again. With his mind overwhelmed by the sheer amount of
            detail put into making the environment feel real his thoughts began
            to wander. How did the system know how to make the ripples in the
            water? How did it simulate the fish swimming or other wildlife going
            about their daily business? Did they simulate erosion when it
            rained? He had so many questions for the developers.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “You did well to keep up, newbie,” Lynn said as she slowed and
            oriented herself vertically. “This is our first stop, Desert View
            Point.”{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Before Adam had had a chance to respond, Lynn shot up to the top of
            the canyon wall and sat down on the edge. Adam and Lee floated up
            and sat down on either side of her.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “This is such a beautiful spot,” Lynn said as they sat down. “How
            far do you think you can see from here?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I don’t know, maybe twenty miles?” Adam shrugged.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lynn covered her mouth with her hand a laughed. “Twenty miles? More
            like over a hundred miles. We flew more than twenty miles just to
            get here. Open your mind up a little more.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Well I’ve never been to the Grand Canyon in real life so I didn’t
            have any idea.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Did you not hear what I just said about opening your mind up? Lee,
            I don’t think he’s good at listening.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>Lee turned, tilted his head, and shrugged.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Alright, well here’s an exercise in opening your mind up. I’ll
            forward you the waypoint for our next stop and you can race me
            there,” Lynn said as she pulled up her console window.{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “But if I’m racing you then I won’t have a chance to admire the
            scenery.” Adam responded.{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Trust me, there will be plenty of other opportunities for you to
            see the Grand Canyon in its entirety,” Lynn retorted as she began
            hovering. “They only change the location every workday in real life
            so you’ve got another two months to explore it.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            While Adam was thinking of another excuse he had an alert message
            pop up in front of his face.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “It looks like Jerry wants to have a meeting with me to see how my
            first day went,” Adam said as he closed the window. “Is there way
            out of here without flying all the way back?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Looks like you have to race me now, otherwise you might be late for
            your important meeting,” Lynn taunted.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “You can’t be serious. There must be a way to teleport back to the
            main tower! This is just like a video game, there should be an exit
            button!”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t,” Lynn said as she started moving
            towards the tower at a snail’s pace. “You probably should’ve read
            all the instructions before we left the tower…”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>“Fine. I’ll ra…”</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lynn had already blasted off, literally, before Adam could finish
            his sentence. His jaw didn’t even have time to drop before they
            heard a boom in the distance. Lynn had broken the sound barrier.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee finally added to the conversation. “She’s already there. Maybe
            you’ll have a fair race, someday, but let her have this one. Now if
            you open a console window I’ll show you the teleport to entrance
            feature.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Show me after we get back to the tower,” Adam said as he started
            hovering. “I’ve got to try what Lynn just did.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam closed his eyes and imagined the fastest thing he could think
            of; a stealth fighter jet. He angled his torso like the plane’s
            body, spread his arms, opened his eyes, and thought of himself
            taking off with his feet as the plane’s thrusters.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Moments later Adam could only see a blur of brown except for
            something white straight ahead.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>THWAK!</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “It’s a good thing you can’t feel pain in this room!” Lynn yelled as
            Adam found himself stuck to the side of the tower.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “That was… fast,” Adam commented as he floated up to where Lynn was
            standing. “I couldn’t see anything.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lynn chuckled. “See anything? If you hadn’t tried to demolish the
            tower you’d probably still be flying till you hit the edge of the
            map.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee appeared in a flash of blue light. “Next time we’re here I’ll
            show you how to teleport back to the tower. It’s been so long since
            Lynn used the feature that she’s probably forgotten how to use it.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The smile that had so recently come to Lynn’s face changed back into
            the scowl from earlier. “Fine, you take him to his meeting while I
            stay here and explore.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee and Adam left without another word for fear of angering Lynn
            more than they had already managed. They walked back through the
            large atrium where they saw a few people lingering around. One had a
            beer in hand while another was reading something on their console
            window. Once they had nearly reached door to go to Jerry’s office
            someone started calling out for Lee.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Hey Lee! Lee!” Louie shouted while running towards them.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lee quickly opened the door and shoved Adam through. “Go on without
            me. It’s the third door on the right. His name will be on it.” He
            shut the door before Adam had a chance to say thanks.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam walked down the hall, found Jerry’s office, which opened as
            soon as he knocked.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I was just about to come looking for you,” Jerry said. “Come in.
            Come in.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Jerry’s office was styled much differently than Adam’s except for
            the live view of Yosemite’s Half Dome. The walls were a dark grey
            stone with fancy hardwood flooring to go with it. On one side of the
            room sat a short bookcase filled with novels with a dragon statuette
            that was nearly three feet long. In the center of the room sat a
            coffee table. The bottom was made of a darker stone than the walls,
            but the top featured stream of lava that followed a fractured path
            through the middle. Four black leather chairs surrounded the coffee
            table each with a wired remote with even more massage settings than
            the one he created for his office. Jerry’s desk sat in the back of
            the room with a black granite top and a gunmetal finish for the
            frame.{' '}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam’s eyes kept wandering back and forth to each unique piece of
            furniture in the room. Each was a work of art alone, but to have
            them all in one place was a magnificent sight.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I’m sorry,” Jerry said as he closed the door and opened his console
            window. “This must look like a pretty menacing office for a boss.
            I’ll have a lighter colored theme in a moment. You can take a seat
            at the coffee table while I get this fixed.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I think it actually looks pretty cool,” Adam complemented as he sat
            down. He hovered his hand over the coffee table to see if the lava
            was just an animation or if it was designed to give off heat. “It’s
            far more interesting than what I put together for my office.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “In that case I won’t worry about it. The darker theme is easier on
            the eyes with every other everywhere else being so bright.” Jerry
            sat down sideways in a chair across from Adam. “Take a look at
            these. I only saw them after I introduced you to Lynn and Lee.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam turned his head towards the wall where he saw four brain
            activity scans. One scan for Jerry, Lee, Lynn and himself.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “This is the brain activity level we all showed at speed ten. All
            our brains are at about the ten percent usage here plus or minus one
            percent. Very few people are outside this range. Now look at what
            happens when we go up to twenty-five.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            With a touch of the console the images changed. Jerry’s had changed
            the most and was up close to forty percent usage. Lynn and Lee were
            at about twenty-five percent and his had stayed at ten percent.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “And then look at what happens when we go to my max of fifty-three.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The images on the wall changed again. Jerry’s was at seventy percent
            while Lynn and Lee were down around fifty percent usage. His still
            hadn’t budged from the ten percent from the first batch of images.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “It’s the same thing when we go to Lynn’s and Lee’s max speeds and
            even when we go to your artificially limited max of one hundred
            twenty.” Jerry changed the screen so it was eight images with Adam’s
            lining the top row and Lynn’s lining the bottom row. “I already told
            you that no one had ever maxed out the system before, but this is
            unprecedented. Either your limit is so far beyond what we can
            achieve with this level of technology or something is wrong with the
            brain scanner. Are you sure you felt fine during the testing?”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Yeah, I uh… felt fine,” Adam responded sounding a little confused.
            “I kept shooting some pool after you left. Nothing felt off when I
            was going through the training videos or the paperwork either. It
            did increase the speed faster when you left, but that was it.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Good, that’s what I thought.” Jerry shifted so he was sitting
            properly in the chair. “I did let the higher ups know because we
            don’t want to risk brain damage of any of our employees from pushing
            their speed too much. When you disconnect to eat your real lunch, we
            should have your real station ready to go so we can retest with new
            hardware when you log back in.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Ok…” Adam’s voice trailed off as his eyes began wandering the room
            again.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “So, did you have some time to get to know Lynn and Lee a bit?
            They’ve spent a lot of time in here so it if things didn’t go
            smoothly at first, you’ll have plenty of time to figure things out.
            You’ll have known them for almost two months by the time you go home
            for the day!”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Two months…” Adam pondered. He had already thought about how much
            time they had spent on the project so far and how much faster they
            got work done in a day, but he hadn’t thought about what it would be
            like to think he was gone for two months when he was really only
            gone for a normal work day. How do you fit two months of stories in
            over dinner every single night? How do you remember everything?
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Things went pretty well with Lynn and Lee today,” Adam said when
            his brain snapped back to Jerry’s office. They work really well
            together, I just hope that I end up being useful to them and the
            project.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “You’ll do great,” Jerry responded. “Even if you’re behind in some
            area you can go back to your office, study up, and be up to speed in
            no time. That’s one of the biggest advantages of being able to
            accelerate time. We don’t need someone who is the absolute best in
            any field because we have the time to train them. Yes, some things
            are still better done in real life, but think of all the time that
            we’ll be able to save.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            This was one of the things that had drawn Adam into this job more
            than any other. Jerry, albeit being a boss who doesn’t directly work
            on the projects, wasn’t afraid to dream big. He didn’t mind how long
            the projects took because they were truly advancing science and the
            human race. Most importantly, it seemed like failure was an option
            as long as something was learned along the way. After all, most of
            what the company did was research until they came up with something
            truly incredible like True VR.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Alright, well that’s really all I had for you today,” Jerry said as
            he got up from his chair. “Go relax in the lounge, have some dinner,
            rearrange your office, I’m sure you’ll think of something to do
            before you get some sleep.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam stood up, shook Jerry’s hand, and headed for the door.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “I’ll schedule another meeting for us in a few days, just to check
            in again and make sure things are still going smoothly,” Jerry
            mentioned as he opened the door.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            “Sounds good sir,” Adam said as he left the room. “See you then.”
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Adam thought about redecorating again when he got back to his office
            after being so impressed by what Jerry had done with his. He
            wondered what Lynn and Lee had done for their offices, but he didn’t
            know either one well enough to be able to guess. Mentally he was
            exhausted from everything he had done so far that he only wrote a
            quick email to his roommate before falling asleep on the couch.

            I know we said we were going to grab a beer to celebrate the new job
            after my first day, but by the time I see you next it’ll have been
            at least two months because of how time works inside the True VR.
            We’re working on some pretty awesome projects, enough that I’ll need
            at least a six pack for how much time I’ll need to tell stories.
